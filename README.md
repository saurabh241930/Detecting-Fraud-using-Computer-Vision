### Objective : To Detect Frauds during check-ins & chek-outs of hotel 

**`Brief overview of pipeline`**  : This project is a part of our one the biggest client and also one of the biggest hotel booking service ,Fraud here actually happens  during customer's check-ins or check-out for its room ,If that time the hotel receptionaist at desk is not registering the record of customer presence in their registory system(online & ofline)the hotel owner is commiting Fraud,because by doing this the our client company is not getting its profit cut

## So this the what process invloved in check-ins & check-outs are made of :
